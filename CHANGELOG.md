# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **`login` / `logout` commands.** `omnyshell login` authenticates to a Hub once
  (verifying the credentials with a real auth handshake) and saves the session to
  `~/.omnyshell/credentials.json` (file mode `600`). Subsequent client commands
  (`connect`, `exec`, `nodes list`, `whoami`) then run without credential flags.
  Sessions are keyed by Hub URL with a remembered default, so multiple Hubs are
  supported; explicit `--principal`/`--token`/`--key` still take precedence.
  `omnyshell logout` removes a saved session (`--hub`) or all of them (`--all`).
  Key-based logins reference the existing Ed25519 seed file by path rather than
  copying the secret.

### Documentation

- Document the `login` / `logout` flow and the credential-free command usage in
  the README, and refresh the badge row (status, tag, commits, PRs, code size).

## 0.2.0

### Added

- **Interactive prompt line.** `omnyshell connect` now shows a `user@node:cwd $`
  prompt before each command. The working directory is tracked live via
  lightweight shell integration (a hidden per-session marker that reports `$PWD`
  after each command), and the prompt is ANSI-colorized when stdout is a TTY
  (honoring `NO_COLOR`).

## 0.1.0

Initial release — Stage 1: secure core and a working `Client → Hub → Node`
vertical slice.

### Added

- **Hub-centric architecture.** Clients connect to a Hub by node identity, not
  by `host:port`. The Hub discovers nodes, authenticates and authorizes
  principals, and brokers sessions.
- **WebSocket-on-TLS transport.** All connections are encrypted; there is no
  plaintext or raw-TCP mode. Nodes dial the Hub outbound and hold a persistent
  control connection (NAT-friendly).
- **Multiplexed channel protocol.** SSH-channel-style multiplexing over a single
  connection: JSON control messages on WebSocket text frames, binary stream data
  (stdin/stdout/stderr) behind a compact 10-byte header on binary frames.
- **Pluggable authentication.** `Authenticator` contract with two
  implementations: `PublicKeyAuthenticator` (Ed25519, `authorized_keys`-style,
  replay-resistant nonce challenge) and `TokenAuthenticator` (bearer).
- **Authorization.** `Authorizer` contract with a default role-based
  implementation enforced by the Hub on every session open.
- **Node runtime.** Connect → authenticate → register → advertise capabilities →
  serve sessions, with automatic reconnect and exponential backoff.
- **Hub broker.** `NodeRegistry`, `SessionRouter` (tunnel relay), and a
  `Clock`-driven `HeartbeatMonitor`.
- **Client SDK.** `execute()` for one-shot commands and `startInteractiveShell()`
  for real-time streaming sessions, plus an extensible local `/` command system.
- **Process shell backend.** `ProcessShellBackend` runs commands via
  `Process.start` behind a `ShellBackend` interface (PTY backend can plug in
  later).
- **CLI.** `omnyshell hub start`, `node start`, `connect`, `exec`, `nodes list`,
  and `whoami`, all built on the public Dart APIs.
- **Tests.** Unit, integration and end-to-end coverage over real `wss` loopback
  connections with a self-signed test certificate.
